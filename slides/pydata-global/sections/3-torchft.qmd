## Beyond fastText ?

- fastText: a powerful and efficient model that has been used in production since 2021...
- ... but the library [repo](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText/) has been archived on March 19th, 2024

This non-maintenance is highly problematic in the medium-term:

::: {.incremental}
- Potential appearance of (non-fixable) [**bugs**]{.orange}
- Conflicting versions of dependencies
- [**Modernization hindrance**]{.orange}
:::

## PyTorch: why ? Some strategic reflections...

💡 Idea: Develop our custom PyTorch-based model to:

::: {.incremental}
- [**adapt**]{.orange} and [**customize**]{.orange} the architecture for our specific needs (text classification with categorical variables)
- limit dependencies to external libraries and [**internalize maintenance**]{.orange} for more robustness in the long-term
- access to the [**vibrant deep learning / NLP community**]{.orange} to develop additional features (**explainability** with [Captum](https://captum.ai/), **calibration** with [torch-uncertainty](https://github.com/ENSTA-U2IS-AI/torch-uncertainty/tree/main)...)...
:::

## Packaging the architecture: why ?

::: {.incremental}
- Conceptually, the model architecture [**has its own life**]{.orange}
    - Can be used for many other use cases
    - Has its own development, versioning etc.
    - **This justifies to have its own repo**, distinct from the train or API one

- [**From an MLOps point of view**]{.orange}:
    - The model is travelling between different teams and repos (train, inference, prod): we need to have a **Single Source of Truth** for easy deployment and versioning!
        - PyPI plays the **remote** role

:::

## Our solution: [torchTextClassifiers](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/torchTextClassifiers)

::: {.incremental}
- **The package:**
    - Conceptualizes the different components of a text classification model to flexibly manipulate them
    - Distributes SOTA architectures incl. self-attention layers (you can make your own small BERT!)
    - Enables to easily instantiate and train those components, while proposing additional features such as [**explainability**]{.orange}
        - You can use any tokenizer from HuggingFace or train your own one

::: {.incremental}
- **Targets:**
    - All those who want to train their home-made - possibly small - models, **customize their architectures** and can't deploy big models from HuggingFace
