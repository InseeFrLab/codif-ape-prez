## 👨‍🔬 Who are we ?

Two data scientists from the innovation team at Insee:

- **Cédric Couralet** <cedric.couralet@insee.fr>
   - Previously software developer, architect, devops/security engineer... at Insee
   - Currently helping real data scientists bridge the gap between experimentation and production ([**How to talk to IT**]{.orange})
   - Open Source advocate


## 👨‍🔬 Who are we ?

Two data scientists from the innovation team at Insee:

- **Meilame Tayebjee** <meilame.tayebjee@insee.fr>
  - Graduated 2024
  - Currently pursuing a part-time PhD in AI applied to health econometrics
  - At Insee: 
    - working on [**deep learning for text classification**]{.orange}, computer vision with remote sensing data, [**MLOps practices**]{.orange}
    - exploring explainability, calibration, LLMs, RAGs & agentic workflows


## 💡 What will we talk about ? {.center}

- [**MLOps pipeline**]{.orange} for [**text classification**]{.orange} at Insee
- The constraint that pushed us to [**open-source a PyTorch package**]{.orange}: why and how


# 1️⃣ Context

{{< include sections/1-contexte.qmd >}}

# 2️⃣ MLOps pipeline

{{< include sections/2-pipeline.qmd >}}

# 3️⃣ _torchTextClassifiers_, an open-source package to distribute PyTorch models

{{< include sections/3-torchft.qmd >}}

# 4️⃣ Perspectives
