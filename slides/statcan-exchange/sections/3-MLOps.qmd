## Current state of affairs

- Model trained on Insee's [**cloud data science platform**]{.orange} :heart_eyes:
- Coding engine [**developed in Java**]{.orange} inside of a monolithic architecture :tired_face:
  - [**Code duplication**]{.blue2}
  - [**Reproductibility**]{.blue2} issues
  - [**Increased risk**]{.blue2} of error
  - [**Maintenance problems**]{.blue2}
  - [**No monitoring**]{.blue2}

## MLOps target

- Microservice architecture running on a [**Kubernetes cluster**]{.orange}
  - Experiment tracking and model store: [**MLflow**]{.blue2}
  - Model served via an API: [**FastAPI**]{.blue2}
  - Monitoring dashboard: [**Quarto**]{.blue2} and [**DuckDB**]{.blue2}
  - Quality control: annotations with [**Label Studio**]{.blue2}
