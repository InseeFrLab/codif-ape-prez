## Context

- [**Sirene**]{.orange} is the French national company registry
- When a company registers, an [**activity code**]{.orange} is attributed
- Early 2023:
  - Refactoring of the Sirene [**information system**]{.blue2}
  - Companies register through a [**new channel**]{.blue2}
  - [**Performance drop**]{.blue2} of the legacy coding engine
  - Teams already [**overwhelmed**]{.blue2}

- [**Consequence**]{.orange}: Ideal moment to innovate (but under the constraint!)
