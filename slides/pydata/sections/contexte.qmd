## Use case

- NACE automatic coding for the national business registry (Sirene)
  - Text classification task with additional variables
- If model is not confident, human annotators enter the loop (_reprise manuelle_)
  - The automatic coding model is highly
- Lot of training data, but not necessarily reliable
  - Coming from previous classification by a deterministic algorithm (Sicore) (1996-2018) and fastText (2018-2025)
- Training on GPU, inference on CPU (secured offline environment)
