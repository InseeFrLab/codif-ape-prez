## Use case (1/2)

::: {.incremental}
- [**NACE automatic coding**]{.orange} (_code APE_) for the national business registry (Sirene)
  - Given an activity description and some additional info, assign one of the ~750 NACE labels
  - [**Sparse-label**]{.orange} extreme multi-class [**text classification task**]{.orange} with categorical variables
- If model is not confident, human annotators enter the loop ([**_reprise manuelle_**]{.orange})
  - The automatic coding model reliability is highly critical
:::

## Use case (2/2)

::: {.incremental}
- Lot of training data, but [**not necessarily reliable**]{.orange}
  - Coming from previous classification by a deterministic algorithm (Sicore) (1996-2021) and fastText (2021-2025)
- Training on GPU but non-batched ([**online**]{.orange}) [**inference on CPU**]{.orange} (secured offline environment)
  - Special care about [**responsive inference time**]{.orange} (<200 ms)
