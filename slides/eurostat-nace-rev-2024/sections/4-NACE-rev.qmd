    - Dual Coding

## 1-to-1 correspondence

- An easy and ideal case

## 1-to-many correspondence

- An ultimately less desirable solution
- Need human decision on textual description

## Annotation campaign strategy

- manual labeling only on the 1-to-many codes
- training data since the implementation of the one-stop shop
- Use Label Studio
- kill two birds with one stone
    - check NACE rev 2 coding quality on the 1-to-many codes
    - attribute a NACE rev 2.1 code
