        - minor coding with NACE rev 2.1
- 2026: administrative business register adopts new NACE
    - Dual Coding
        - major coding with NACE rev 2.1
        - minor coding with NACE rev 2

## 1-to-1 correspondence

- An easy and ideal case

## 1-to-many correspondence

- An ultimately less desirable solution
- Need expert decision based on activity description

## Annotation campaign strategy

- A one-shot operation spanning multiple months in 2024
- manual labeling only on the 1-to-many codes
- select data to annotate since the implementation of the one-stop shop
- kill two birds with one stone
    - check NACE rev 2 coding quality on the 1-to-many codes
    - attribute a NACE rev 2.1 code

## Reduce tasks to annotate

- theoretical 1-to-many scenarios can eventually become 1-to-1 in practice
- duplicated textual descriptions may occur due to shared practices among registrants.

- How to reduce the annotation workload for our annotators ?
    - adapt correspondence table by considering real-world business rules
    - avoid giving the same textual descriptions to annotate
