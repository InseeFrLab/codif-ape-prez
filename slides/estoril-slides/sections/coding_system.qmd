## Performance

- Evaluation on historical data: very high accuracy of 89%
- With newer hand-coded data: reduced accuracy of 80% due to a distribution shift in the data
- Company activities evolve over time. New businesses appear, businesses traditionally associated
with a certain activity may see this activity evolve, etc.
