## Description of the coding system

- [**Sirene**]{.orange} is the French national company registry
- When a company registers, an [**activity code**]{.orange} is attributed
- A model trained on historical Sirene data is used when it is confident enough. Otherwise, the description is given a code manually

## Modeling

## Performance

- Evaluation on historical data: very high accuracy of 89%
- With newer hand-coded data: reduced accuracy of 80% due to a distribution shift in the data
- Company activities evolve over time. New businesses appear, businesses traditionally associated
with a certain activity may see this activity evolve, etc.
