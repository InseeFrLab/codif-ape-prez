## Periodic retraining

- Company activities evolve over time. A first strategy is to [**retrain the model periodically**]{.orange}
- How frequently ? There is a [**tradeoff**]{.orange} as there should be a validation procedure to use a new model in production  
- In our case, distribution shifts are not large. It is reasonable to [**retrain twice a year**]{.orange}

## Additional retraining

- [**Additional specific retraining procedures**]{.orange} can be triggered:
  - When the monitoring system [**detects unusual shifts**]{.blue2} in the data
  - When [**repeated claims**]{.blue2} are made by certain companies on their activity code
  - When [**coding concepts change**]{.blue2}

## What training data ?

- When retraining a model from scratch: [**how far should we go in the past**]{.orange} to build the training set ?
- [**Empirical evaluation**]{.orange} is necessary:
  - Model capabilities [**scale**]{.blue2} with training data
  - Older data has [**lower quality labels**]{.blue2}

## What training data ?
