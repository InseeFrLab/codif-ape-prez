## Periodic retraining

- Company activities evolve over time. A first strategy is to retrain the model periodically
- How frequently ? There is a tradeoff as there should be a validation procedure to use a new model in production  
- In our case, distribution shifts are not large. It is reasonable to retrain twice a year

## Additional retraining

- Additional specific retraining procedures can be triggered:
  - When the monitoring system detects unusual shifts in the data
  - When repeated claims are made by certain companies on their activity code
  - When coding concepts change

## What training data ?

- When retraining a model from scratch: how far should we go in the past to build the training set ?
- Empirical evaluation is necessary:
  - Model capabilities scale with training data
  - Older data has lower quality labels

## What training data ?
