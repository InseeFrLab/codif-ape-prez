## Machine learning in official statistics

- Today, [**machine learning**]{.orange} systems contribute effectively to the production of official statistics
- [**Coding engines**]{.orange}, data editing: outlier detection, imputation
- CoP: "Source data, integrated data, intermediate results and statistical outputs [must be] [**regularly assessed and validated**]{.orange}" and "revisions [must be] regularly analysed in order to improve source data, statistical processes and outputs"
- This naturally applies [**when ML systems are leveraged**]{.orange} in the process of producing statistics

## Quality of ML systems

- A ML model is trained to solve a task [**based on reference data**]{.orange}
- Real-life data [**can deviate**]{.orange} from the reference data, which leads to performance issues
- [**Retraining is necessary**]{.orange} to avoid these issues
