## Machine learning in official statistics

- Today, machine learning systems contribute effectively to the production of official statistics
- Coding engines, data editing: outlier detection, imputation
- CoP: "Source data, integrated data, intermediate results and statistical outputs [must be] regularly assessed and validated" and
"revisions [must be] regularly analysed in order to improve source data, statistical processes and outputs"
- This naturally applies when ML systems are leveraged in the process of producing statistics

## Quality of ML systems

- A ML model is trained to solve a task based on reference data
- Real-life data can deviate from the reference data, which leads to performance issues
- Retraining is necessary to avoid these issues
