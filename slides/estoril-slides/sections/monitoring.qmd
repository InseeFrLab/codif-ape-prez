## Design

- The model is served via a REST API (developed with FastAPI)
- A process fetches logs daily, parses them and logs their content on a persistent storage 
- An interactive dashboard is built with Quarto to offer insight on data and how it is coded

## Dashboard

## Dashboard

## Continuous performance evaluation

- We continuously increment an evaluation set to monitor the performance of the ML system 
- Batches are sampled from recent Sirene data and uploaded onto Label Studio
- For now data is shared between annotators and each description is coded once (could change in the future)
- The dashboard is enriched with additional tabs leveraging evaluation data
