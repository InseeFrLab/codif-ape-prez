## ML Model Robustness

- ML models are trained using [**reference datasets**]{.orange} tailored for a specific task.
- In practice, real-world data often [**drifts over time**]{.orange} from these reference sets ➡️ performance degradation?
- Regular [**retraining**]{.orange} becomes essential.
- A particularly challenging case in public statistics is the [**change in classification systems**]{.blue2}.
